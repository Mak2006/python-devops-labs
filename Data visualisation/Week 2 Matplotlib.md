# Matplotlib

1. John Hunter created this, heavily influenced by the beauty of Matlab
2. **Architecture in brief** 
	1. Artist  Layer - contains containers such as Figure, Subplot which are object representing graphs.  Also contains object to represent data such as Collections.
	2. Backend Layer  - rendering engine of the plots  
	3. Scripting Layer - programs to choreographs the AL and BL and also customizes. Mastering this layer is required for being an expert. We use PyPlot for this. 
3. **Plotting Paradigms** - Matplotlib's pyplot is an example of a _procedural_ method for building visualizations while SVG, HTML are _declarative_ methods of creating visualizations.
4.  **Ten Simple Rules for Better Figures** - [doi:10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003833] 
		1. Know your audience
