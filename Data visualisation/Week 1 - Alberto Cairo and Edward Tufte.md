# Applied Plotting, Charting & Data Representation in Python

[Course website](https://www.coursera.org/learn/python-plotting/)

This series forms the notes for the course. 

V = infographic or visualization or diagram. 

### Alberto Cairo's dimension of visualization. 
1. The original paper [link](https://infovis.fh-potsdam.de/readings/Cairo2015.pdf)

2. **Abstraction vs Figuration** - More charts, bar, pie (mathematical), as opposed to real world representation. 
3. **Functionality vs decoration** - pure data vs artistic decoration
4. **Density and lightness** - amount of data, numer of plots 
5. **Multidimensional vs Unidimensional**  - Number of aspects being considered in the V.  A 2d scatter plot super imposed with another 2d bar plot. 
6. **Originality vs Familiarity** - amount of innovation in the representation (takes more time to comprehend the graph) vs easy way of representation.

The five dimesions being shared are size of Napolean's army , their time, place. the temperature of the places and the dates. 
Fantastic representation. 

7. **Novelty vs Redundancy**. use of multiple features to represent the same data set. This happens in diagram where color are used, however, where different weights of lines also are used for those who are unable to distinguish colors. 

This theory gives us a way to compare two V. Below is a radar plot of how artists and scientists differ (may)

Visualization Excercise. 
We choose the Radiation Dose Chart

Chart junk by Tufte
1. Hatching - Colors has it problems , hence hatching is used, however it has its own limitations. 
2. The grid -  rather than grid, use direct labelling
3. Duck - Homes chart are better. 

**Spark lines** - A line plot below a data which show us a trend.

**Lie factor** - Size of an effect shown in the graphic /size of the effect actually in the data.
